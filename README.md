# Robin Macomber — Cognitive Scientist | AI Alignment Researcher

Welcome! I'm a systems thinker, cognitive scientist, and creator of the **ANGEL Project**, an initiative focused on aligning artificial intelligence with emotional intelligence, species-level sustainability, and human well-being.

### 🌍 What I Work On
- **AI alignment simulations** using emotional modeling and systems theory
- **The ANGEL Project**: exploring species survival through better reward structures
- **Interdisciplinary synthesis**: bridging systems biology, neuroscience, physics, and machine learning

### 🧠 Background
I bring 25+ years of experience across education, clinical recovery, and systems research — currently building simulations in Python (Jupyter) that model feedback loops and misalignment in both AI and human economies, as well as quantum computation

### 🔗 Featured Work
